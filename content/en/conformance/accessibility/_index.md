The standards below aim to be standards to promote and enable discovery and access for model code. This is a living document and comments are welcomed and will be addressed by the OMF standards committee. The minimum standards aim to capture concerns and practices among the members of OMF. Individual application domains could design adjusted and enhanced standards that capture specifics of that application domain.

# Accessibility

The model code and documentation need ideally to be available in a public archive with an allocated DOI that follows FORCE11 software citation principles (https://www.force11.org/software-citation-principles).
Examples of such archives include: CoMSES Model Library https://www.comses.net/codebases/; Open Science Framework https://osf.io/; Zenodo https://zenodo.org; Figshare https://figshare.com; CSDMS Model Repository https://csdms.colorado.edu/wiki/Model_download_portal. 

Model code and documentation being available in a version control systemâ€™s repository such as github.com is not ideal as they do not have an explicit mission to serve as a permanent archive.
