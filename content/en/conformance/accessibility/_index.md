These standards promote and enable discovery and access for model code, documentation, and metadata. This is a living document and comments are welcomed and will be addressed by the OMF standards committee. The minimum standards aim to capture concerns and practices among the members of OMF. Individual application domains may extend these standards to capture additional context relevant to their domain.

# Accessibility

Model code and documentation should be archived in a durable digital repository that issues DOIs or other permanent identifiers. The archive should adhere to FORCE11 software citation principles (https://www.force11.org/software-citation-principles) and expose their metadata in open, interoperable formats like schema.org or codemeta.

Examples of such archives include: CoMSES Model Library https://www.comses.net/codebases/; the Open Science Framework https://osf.io/; Zenodo https://zenodo.org; Figshare https://figshare.com; CSDMS Model Repository https://csdms.colorado.edu/wiki/Model_download_portal. 

Model code and documentation being available in a version control systemâ€™s repository such as github.com is not recommended as they do not have an explicit mission to serve as a permanent archive and there are no protections or mechanisms to guard against data removal.
