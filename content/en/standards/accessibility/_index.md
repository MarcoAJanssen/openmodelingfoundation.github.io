These standards promote and enable discovery and access for model code, documentation, and metadata.

## Overview of Accessibility Standards

## Goals for Accessibility Standards
•	Humans can read the model source code 
•	Machines can read the model source code 
•	Models are accessible by a proper citation
•	Models expose their metadata in interoperable format -> link to accessibility and interoperability
•	Models should be available in findable archives.

## Minimal Accessibility Standards

Model code and documentation should be archived in a searchable, open access, trusted digital repository. A DOI, permanent URL or other permanent digital resource locator for accessing the model code must be provided that links to the specific version of the code used. The archive should adhere to FORCE11 software citation principles (https://www.force11.org/software-citation-principles) and expose their metadata in open, interoperable formats like schema.org or codemeta.

## Ideal Accessibility Standards

•	sponsors require model source code publicly available in archive
•	journals require model source code publicly available in archive.
•	using programming tools that facilitate accessibility (example: Python PIP)
•	 Availability of models independent of platforms via containerization

## Cyberinfrastructure and Tools for Implementation of Accessibility Standards

Create a  checklist for the OMF website (and for training). Code for openness from the start.
•	Can you run your model on another computer/operating system?
•	Is your model code readable by somebody else (variable names, comments, description procedures, cleaned up)?
•	where can we find your code in 3 to 5 years (link to archives), and know the specific version?
•	can you run your model in 3 to 5 years (containerization (what to do with prop. software - advise open software)?
•	Is the model publicly available?
