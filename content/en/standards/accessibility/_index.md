{{% standards-preamble %}}
These standards promote and enable discovery and access for model code, documentation, and metadata.
{{% /standards-preamble %}}

Overarching goals
- Accessibility of model source code in an archive which adhere to FORCE11 software citation principles and expose their metadat in open, interoperable formats.
- Model sources code has an appropriate OSI approved license.
- Model developers make their code of published academic work acessible. 
- Sponsors require model code from sponsored research to be accesible.
- Journals require model code of published articles to be accessible.
- Code archives make model code discoverable by humans and machines in the long term.

What about links to follow up versions (bug fixes)?

Model code and documentation should be archived in a searchable, open access, trusted digital repository. A DOI, permanent URL or other permanent digital resource locator for accessing the model code must be provided that links to the specific version of the code used. The archive should adhere to FORCE11 software citation principles (https://www.force11.org/software-citation-principles) and expose their metadata in open, interoperable formats like schema.org or codemeta.

A list of trusted digital repositories can be found at https://www.comses.net/resources/trusted-digital-repositories/ [perhaps becoming part of OMF website?]

Model code and documentation being available in a version control systemâ€™s repository such as github.com is not recommended as they do not have an explicit mission to serve as a permanent archive and there are no protections or mechanisms to guard against data removal.
